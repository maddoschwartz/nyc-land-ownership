## Future Work

Future work could include:

1. Aggregating and displaying public land-owners

    There are some public land-owners that could be of interest
    - STATE UNIVERSITY OF (of what??)
    - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
    - NEW YORK STATE DEPARTMENT
    - NYC DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION

2. Map an overlay of LandUse

    Some values in the data include Transportaiton/Utility, Industrial/Manufacturing, etc.

4. Making the map interactive

    Make a map that lets you zoom in-out and hover over to discover more information.
